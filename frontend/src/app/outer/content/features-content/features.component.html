        <p class="lead">The application provides the possibility to create a bet or a competition by one of the
          interested users. During the creation, the user fills in the rules and defines the conditions under which one
          of the participants wins. Then the user defines who will be the judge and opponent in the bet and invites
          other users to the bet. During the bet, users can discuss the bet in chat and send photos. After the bet is
          completed, the judge determines the winner.</p>
